    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I love these no-cook overnight oats! It's easy to make up a few of these at a time for a quick, on-the-go breakfast. You can use different spices or maple syrup and your favorite berry or fruit.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Use oat milk, almond milk, or whatever milk alternative you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Oats:</strong> Make sure to use rolled oats.</li>
        <li><strong>Chia seeds:</strong> Fiber-rich chia seeds add flavor and nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Enhance the overall flavor with ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Berries:</strong> Though this recipe calls for blueberries, you can use almost any fruit. Bananas, peaches, or any variety of berries work best.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, yogurt, oats, honey, chia seeds, and cinnamon in a 1/2-pint jar with a lid; cover and shake until combined.</li>
        <li>Open the jar and fold in the fruit.</li>
        <li>Seal the jar and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
